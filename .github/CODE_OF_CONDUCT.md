# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind. Be respectful. Help each other out.

## The Slightly Longer Version

This is a hobby project built in the open. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting code — we're glad you're here.

**We expect everyone to:**

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Accept feedback gracefully (and give it kindly)
- Focus on what's best for the project and community
- Remember there's a human on the other side of the screen

**We won't tolerate:**

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Discrimination of any kind
- Being a jerk

## Enforcement

If someone is making the community unwelcoming, they'll be asked to stop. If they continue, they'll be removed.

## Questions?

Open an issue or reach out to the maintainers. We're happy to help.
